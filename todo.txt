Make 'suggested redirects' file, where if an article/event is found using wordpress search, suggest redirecting to the first post found

Make the custom 404 redirects work in a way that looks at what's after the category, then tries redirecting to an article with that name and the proper url structure for the category, and then if that doesn't work just redirect to the category page
